 ## General description of the script
 
In the midst of an unprecedented heat wave and ongoing drought, northeastern Argentina suffered a series of forest fires in nature reserves and fields. Through the Sentinel Hub EO Browser tool with its personalized script, the wetland humidity data was related to the surface temperature, in order to prevent and be able to carry out the necessary tasks to minimize this natural disaster, which has drought and the protection of wetlands as protagonists.  

In mid-January 2022, sweltering heat gripped central South America, with temperatures soaring to over 40°C (104°F). At the time, it was the hottest place on the planet [2]

 ## Details of the script
 
 The images acquired by the Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI-2) on Landsat 9 on February 16, 2022, show the scorched fields and heavy smoke from the multiple wildfires still burning near Iberá National Park.[1]
